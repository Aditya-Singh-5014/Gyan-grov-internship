// COMPONENTS 
Components are divided into their folders and their respective CSS are also present in their respective folders 

// IMAGES
Images are manually downloaded and then uploaded to the website using <img> tag 'cause the API fetch for the IMAGES was not working in the website, so i made the website photos random.

//API

Although the image did not respond to the fetching, all the other items were fetched correctly.

//RESPONSIVENESS

The website is designed to be responsive across three display sizes:

1. Full-screen display for laptops/computers.
2. Half-screen displays like iPads and tablets, optimized at 1220px width.
3. Mobile phones, specifically targeting the "iPhone 14 Pro Max" with consideration for a width of 500px.
